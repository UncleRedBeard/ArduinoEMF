Arduinio EMF Detector
=====================
Frist module in larger diy ghost detector project. Initially, using a 1M ohm resistor
connected to the antenna. It needs additional testing using different levels of resistors,
but for now it works well. Also, I need to add functionality to use different colored LEDs
to signal location of emf detection.
